    We are working towards confidence to people. 
    Towards empowering them. Mainly we are focusing on college students and ladies. We don't want that 
    you stop because of your outfits. I have seen it personally that some students often stop them from interacting with 
    other students because they feel that they don't really belong there.
    <p>Students from middle class and lower middle class background and coming from smaller cities and towns have this situation.
        They don't interact because of fear of embarrassement. They also can't really make big investments into clothing.
    </p>
    <p>So, we came here at rescue. We offer simple and affordable subscription to students to get branded vlothese everyday and go out with confidence.
        They are all skilled and capable but just lack confidence in big a city like Delhi. But after this confidence, they can showcase
        their talents and skills and get the recognition and respect they deserve.
    </p>
    <p>We are working for these students and all people who need our support. Right now, we are supporting this way but in future 
        if something more would be needed we would be happy doing it.
    </p>
    <p>Please help us in our mission and let's empower students and ladies, together.</p>
